A Clinically Oriented antimicrobial Resistance Network (ACORN) is a Wellcome funded project led by the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit and the Oxford University of Oxford Clinical Research Unit. This is the code repository for the ACORN Project.


### ACORN Repository

This is the public repository of the R package `ACORN`. This is essentially the source code for the shiny app that has been bundled as a R package for easy deployment. (The app code is located in the inst folder).
To launch the app locally, install this package `devtools::install_github("ocelhay/ACORN")`,
run it `library(ACORN)`, `runACORN()`

### Online App

The App will soon be accessible at [http://www.acornamr.net](http://www.acornamr.net) and, by the mean time, is deployed at [https://moru.shinyapps.io/acornamr_prototype/](https://moru.shinyapps.io/acornamr_prototype/)
